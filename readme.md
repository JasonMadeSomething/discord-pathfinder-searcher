The goal of this bot is to parse URLs from the pathfinder d20pfsrd and return them to discord chat as readable text.


EX:
https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/focused-shot-combat

should cause the bot to relpy with something roughly like this

**Prerequisites**: Int 13, [Point Blank Shot](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/focused-shot-combat/point-blank-shot-combat), [Precise Shot](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/focused-shot-combat/precise-shot-combat).

**Benefit**: As a standard action, you may make an attack with a bow or crossbow and add your Intelligence modifier on the damage roll. You must be within 30 feet of your target to deal this extra damage.
Creatures immune to critical hits and sneak attacks are immune to this extra damage.

**Special**: Starting at 2nd level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Focused Shot as a combat style feat.
